#### **»** Abstract
The cognitive diagnostic model (CDM) is a type of restricted latent class model which can generate a fine breakdown of the skills or attributes possessed by students that affect performance. The application of the traditional CDMs mainly focuses on providing a classification of skills or attributes at a given point in time.  However, in the context of education students usually learn and master content over time. In this talk, we introduce a family of learning models that integrates the CDM framework with a higher-order, hidden Markov model (HO-HMM) for attribute transitions. This new modeling framework allows us to model transitions from non-mastery to mastery of an attribute as a function of student covariates. A Bayesian formulation is adopted to estimate parameters from the proposed learning model. We apply this model to analyze students’ learning trajectories in a computer-based 3-D spatial skills cognitive diagnostic assessment with learning tools. The spatial reasoning example indicates the benefits of practice, and the value of knowing some of the attributes, on the probability of making a transition to a master of a fixed attribute. It also revealed significant heterogeneity in individual learning rates. Students’ demographic variables, such as country, gender, and major, are incorporated in the proposed model to better evaluate the designed intervention and investigate the impact of the social factors.

#### **»** Short Bio
Dr. Shiyu Wang is an Assistant Professor of the Quantitative Methodology Program, the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Georgia.  She is also the adjunct Assistant Professor of Statistics at UGA. Before moving to this position, she got her PhD in statistics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Dr Wang’s primary research interests lie broadly in multivariate latent variable methodology for the measurement of complex traits and behaviors with application to educational and psychological assessment. Her current research interests are centered on two areas: statistical inference in latent variable modeling and adaptive testing, including item response theory, cognitive diagnostic modeling, computerized adaptive testing, and multistage adaptive testing.
