# MotifExpress

</summary>
<br>

MotifExpress1 is a tool for rapidly discovering cis-regulatory motifs by correlating sequence to expression data. It will discover motifs whose presence is best correlated with changes in genome-wide gene expression from a control state to an experimental state. It uses expression data as measured by microarray or RNA-seq, and repeatmasked sequence data from regions relevant to the genes whose expression has been measured.

## -Installing MotifExpress  
MotifExpress was designed for win32 systems, and requires a number of prerequisites to function. You should download them first if you do not have them:
* Python 2.5+
  * Numpy
* R 2.6.2
  * abind — download from inside R
  * impute — download from BioConductor
  * samr — download from BioConductor

Download MotifExpress [here](https://uofi.app.box.com/s/n1y3p3e4ntgcwjd9b8j2).

# Correlation Pursuit

</summary>
<br>

Correlation Pursuit (COP) is the package for selecting variables for SDR models via correlation pursuit. Unlike linear stepwise regression, COP does not impose a special form of relationship (such as linear) between the response variable and the predictor variables. The COP procedure selects variables that attain the maximum correlation between the transformed response and the linear combination of the variables. Various asymptotic properties of the COP procedure are established and, in particular, its variable selection performance under a diverging number of predictors and sample size is investigated. The excellent empirical performance of the COP procedure in comparison with existing methods is demonstrated in *“Correlation pursuit: forward stepwise variable selection for index models”*.
