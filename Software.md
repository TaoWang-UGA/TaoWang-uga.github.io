  # MotifExpress

MotifExpress1 is a tool for rapidly discovering cis-regulatory motifs by correlating sequence to expression data. It will discover motifs whose presence is best correlated with changes in genome-wide gene expression from a control state to an experimental state. It uses expression data as measured by microarray or RNA-seq, and repeatmasked sequence data from regions relevant to the genes whose expression has been measured.
