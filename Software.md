  # MotifExpress

</summary>
<br>

MotifExpress1 is a tool for rapidly discovering cis-regulatory motifs by correlating sequence to expression data. It will discover motifs whose presence is best correlated with changes in genome-wide gene expression from a control state to an experimental state. It uses expression data as measured by microarray or RNA-seq, and repeatmasked sequence data from regions relevant to the genes whose expression has been measured.

## -Installing MotifExpress  
MotifExpress was designed for win32 systems, and requires a number of prerequisites to function. You should download them first if you do not have them:
* Python 2.5+
* * Numpy
