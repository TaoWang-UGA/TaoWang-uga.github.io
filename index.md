# Welcome to the Zhong Lab at the University of Georgia
Our research focuses on statistical methodology and theory development to face the striking new phenomena that emerged under the big data regime. Over the past few years, Dr. Zhong has established diverse extramurally funded research programs to overcome the computational and theoretical challenges that arise from big data analysis. Basic statistical researches are successfully applied in modern genomic, epigenetic, metagenomics, text-mining, chemical sensing, and brain imaging research.
More specifically, our research focuses on those research thrusts:
## Feature selection in high dimensional regression
Classical statistical theory considered small-sized datasets, with n observations and p carefully chosen variables. The statistical asymptotic is established by fixing p but letting n go to infinity. These theoretical results cannot be generalized to big data analytics because, when p is bounded, the large n-behavior already sets in relatively small n. For big data analytics, it makes sense to assume that n and p are both large; and in some cases, it even makes sense to assume that p is much larger than n â€“ a situation that would have been totally forbidden classically. One of our research goals is to establish the theoretical underpinning of the existing statistical tools under the big data regime. This work was supported by NSF DMS 1120256 and NSF DMS 1406843 to WZ.
