### Professor Wenxuan Zhong’s Research, Microbiome Analysis Tool——MetaGen, was Featured in UGA Today.
Monday, January 22, 2018<br>

A new computational tool developed by Professor Wenxuan Zhong and her team at the University of Georgia shows promise for further understanding and identifying the complicated makeup of the microbiome. With the creation of this new big data tool, researchers will help identify differences in patterns of microbes that may lead to a better understanding of chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity.<br>

## Professor Wenxuan Zhong’s Research, New Statistics for Smelling Out Disease, was Featured in Scientia.
Cutting-edge scientific techniques are generating a wealth of details about biological systems. This information could enable the rapid detection of disease and toxic substances, and provide insights into the mechanisms behind complex diseases. However, teasing out elusive signals in these biochemical datasets can be complicated, so statistician Professor Wenxuan Zhong and her team at the University of Georgia are developing new numerical methods to unlock their secrets.<br>

### Xin Xing develops a high-performance computation algorithm on the human microbiome using advanced DNA sequencing technology
Xin Xing uses advanced DNA sequencing technology to develop high-performance computation algorithms on the human microbiome – the collection of the many diverse types of micro-organisms that occupy almost every part of the human body. Xing’s algorithm has been applied to two real-world data sets: one relating to type-2 diabetes patients and another to inflammatory bowel disease patients. The algorithm successfully identified more than 2,000 microbial species, of which less than 10 percent have reference genomes available. In total, eight pathogenic microbial species have been identified by the algorithm. This includes seven unknown species and one known species related to inflammatory bowel disease (Bateroides fragilis).

Congratulations!

### Dr. Wenxuan Zhong and Xin Xing of the University of Georgia used Bridges to assemble 378 billion base pairs of bacterial DNA
Bridges, PSC’s new National Science Foundation-funded computing system, has seen its first month of use by the national scientific community. In that short time,  Wenxuan Zhong and Xin Xing used Bridges to assemble 378 billion base pairs of bacterial DNA from the intestines of healthy patients and those with diabetes. The team is now using Bridges to test a new statistical method on the sequence data to identify critical differences in gut microbes associated with diabetes.

DNA methylation has been newly discovered as a key controller in gene transcription. Aberrant DNA methylation changes can cause a number of human diseases such as developmental diseases (ICF syndrome, Prader-Willi, and Angelman syndromes, etc), aging related diseases (i.e. Alzheimer’s disease), heart disease, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, a large amount of evidence implicated that DNA methylation is a key player in cancer development. Dr. Zhong will develop a suite of statistical models to broaden our understanding of how methylation patterns are established and maintained during normal development and under different environmental conditions.
